GO CONCEPTS AND LEARNING DOCUMENTATION
====================================

This document tracks the Go concepts learned and implemented in the BlackJack project.

1. BASIC GO CONCEPTS
-------------------

a) Packages
   Definition: Packages are Go's unit of code organization and reuse
   Example from our code:
       package deck
   Key Terms:
   - package declaration
   - internal packages (private to project)
   - importing packages
   - package organization

b) Types
   Definition: Go's way of defining new types based on existing ones
   Example from our code:
       type Suit string
       type Rank string
   Key Terms:
   - type declaration
   - underlying type
   - type safety
   - custom types

c) Constants
   Definition: Values that cannot be modified after declaration
   Example from our code:
       const (
           Hearts   Suit = "Hearts"
           Diamonds Suit = "Diamonds"
       )
   Key Terms:
   - const keyword
   - constant blocks
   - typed constants
   - iota for enums

2. COMPOSITE TYPES
-----------------

a) Structs
   Definition: User-defined type that groups related data
   Example from our code:
       type Card struct {
           Suit Suit
           Rank Rank
       }
   Key Terms:
   - struct fields
   - field types
   - struct initialization
   - composition

b) Slices
   Definition: Dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink
   Example from our code:
       cards []Card
   Key Terms:
   - length (len)
   - capacity (cap)
   - append function
   - make function
   - slice operations

c) Maps
   Definition: Key-value data structures
   Example from our code:
       var suitSymbols = map[Suit]string{
           Hearts: "♥",
       }
   Key Terms:
   - key-value pairs
   - map initialization
   - map lookup
   - zero value (nil)
   - existence checking

3. FUNCTIONS AND METHODS
-----------------------

a) Regular Functions
   Definition: Reusable blocks of code
   Example from our code:
       func NewCard(suit Suit, rank Rank) (Card, error)
   Key Terms:
   - function declaration
   - parameters
   - return values
   - multiple returns
   - named returns

b) Methods
   Definition: Functions attached to types
   Example from our code:
       func (c Card) Value() int
   Key Terms:
   - receiver
   - method set
   - pointer receivers
   - value receivers
   - method chaining

4. ERROR HANDLING
----------------

Definition: Go's way of handling exceptional conditions
Example from our code:
    if _, ok := suitSymbols[suit]; !ok {
        return Card{}, fmt.Errorf("invalid suit: %s", suit)
    }
Key Terms:
- error interface
- multiple return values
- error checking
- fmt.Errorf
- error propagation

5. TESTING
----------

Definition: Go's built-in testing framework
Example from our code:
    func TestCardValue(t *testing.T)
Key Terms:
- test functions
- testing.T
- table-driven tests
- test coverage
- subtests
- test helpers

6. INPUT/OUTPUT
--------------

Definition: Handling user input and output
Example from our code:
    reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
    input, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
Key Terms:
- bufio.Reader
- os.Stdin/Stdout
- string formatting
- ANSI escape codes
- error handling

7. STATE MANAGEMENT
------------------

Definition: Tracking and managing program state
Example from our code:
    type GameState int
    const (
        WaitingToStart GameState = iota
        PlayerTurn
        DealerTurn
        RoundOver
    )
Key Terms:
- state enumeration
- state transitions
- iota usage
- encapsulation
- getter methods

8. USER INTERFACE
----------------

Definition: Command-line interface design
Example from our code:
    func getPlayerInput() string
Key Terms:
- command processing
- user prompts
- screen clearing
- formatted output
- input validation

9. DESIGN PATTERNS
-----------------

a) Constructor Pattern
   Definition: Functions that create and initialize types
   Example from our code:
       func NewDeck() *Deck

b) State Pattern
   Definition: Object behavior depends on its state
   Example from our code:
       - Game state management
       - Player state transitions

c) Command Pattern
   Definition: Encapsulate requests as objects
   Example from our code:
       - Command processing in main.go
