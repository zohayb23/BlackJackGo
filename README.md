# BlackJack in Go

A command-line implementation of the BlackJack card game using Go. This project serves as a learning exercise for Go programming concepts and best practices.

## Project Overview

This BlackJack implementation showcases:

- Object-oriented programming in Go
- Clean code architecture
- Test-driven development
- Command-line interface design
- Professional development practices

## Current Progress

### Completed Features âœ“

- Basic project structure and Git setup
- Card implementation with:
  - Value calculation
  - Suit and rank representation
  - String formatting
  - Validation
  - 100% test coverage
- Deck implementation with:
  - Standard 52-card deck creation
  - Shuffling functionality
  - Card drawing
  - Remaining cards tracking
  - 100% test coverage
- Player implementation with:
  - Hand management
  - State tracking (Playing, Standing, Busted, BlackJack)
  - Card value calculation with Ace handling
  - 97% test coverage

### In Progress ðŸš§
